# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. My name is Devin. I go by He/Him pronouns. I like to play rogue like games along with fps games. I'm taking this class in order to learn how to code games. I've done a few projects in other GDIM classes where I had to make some physical games. I'm hoping to build rogue like games in the future. 

2. GDIM

3. I'm hoping to learn how to code a game since I have pretty much zero experience with coding. 
4. I'm a bit nervous about the group project at the end. 

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. N/A

2. N/A

3. N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. A document that describes your game concept and the specifics of what it needs. 

2. N/A

3. Iteration is pretty much making changes to your game concept until you like it. 

4. N/A
   
5. N/A
